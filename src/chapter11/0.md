ミニアプリを作ります。結局、プログラミングは何かを作るのが一番です。Rustは基礎が大切すぎるのでここまでここまでかなり詰め込みましたが、開放するときです。

作るものはgrepアプリです。

grepとは、テキストファイルやコマンドの出力結果から特定の文字列やパターンに一致する行を検索・抽出するコマンド（ツール）のことです。

srcフォルダと同階層に`book.txt`というファイルを作成し、下記の文章を入れてください。

In a world that never stops talking, silence has become a rare luxury
 Every day, we are bombarded with a ceaseless stream of notifications, emails, headlines, and advertisements
 Our attention is fragmented, sold to the highest bidder in an economy that thrives on distraction
 In this noisy landscape, the act of reading a book is no longer just a hobby; it is a radical act of resistance and self-preservation

Unlike the rapid scroll of social media, where information is consumed in bite-sized pieces, reading demands patience
 It requires us to slow down and surrender to a singular narrative
 When we open a book, we step out of the frantic current of modern life and enter a sanctuary of focus
 This sustained attention acts as a workout for the brain, strengthening our ability to concentrate in an era where our focus spans are shrinking

Furthermore, reading is the ultimate engine of empathy
 When we watch a movie, we are observers looking at a character
 But when we read, we inhabit the character’s mind
 We experience their fears, their joys, and their internal conflicts as if they were our own
 Fiction, in particular, allows us to live a thousand lives in the span of one
 It bridges the gap between "us" and "them," fostering a deeper understanding of perspectives that differ from our own

Moreover, reading offers a unique form of mental rest
 It is active enough to keep the mind engaged, preventing the ruminating thoughts that often cause anxiety, yet passive enough to allow the body to relax
 It is a form of deep engagement that rejuvenates rather than exhausts

In conclusion, while technology connects us globally, it often disconnects us from ourselves
 Reading invites us back
 It reminds us that in a fast-paced world, there is immense power in sitting still, turning a page, and letting our imagination take flight
 It is not just about acquiring knowledge; it is about reclaiming the quiet space where our own thoughts can finally breathe
